    "# The Guardian API\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `beautiful_soup.ipynb` notebook, I showed how BeautifulSoup can be used \n",
    "to parse messy HTML, tp extract information, and to act as a rudimentary web crawler. \n",
    "I used The Guardian as an illustrative example about how this can be achieved. \n",
    "The reason for choosing The Guardian was because they provide a REST API to their servers. \n",
    "With theise it is possible to perform specific queries on their servers, and to receive \n",
    "current information from their servers according to their API guide (ie in JSON)\n",
    "\n",
    "http://open-platform.theguardian.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use their API, you will need to register for an API key. \n",
    "At the time of writing (Feb 1, 2017) this was an automated process that can be completed at \n",
    "\n",
    "http://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/\n",
    "\n",
    "The API is documented here: \n",
    "\n",
    "http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/\n",
    "\n",
    "and Python bindings to their API are provided by The Guardian here\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/prabhath6/theguardian-api-python\n",
    "\n",
    "and these can easily be integrated into a web-crawler based on API calls, rather than being based \n",
    "on HTML parsing, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use four parameters in our queries here: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `section`: the section of the newspaper that we are interested in querying. In this case I'm lookin in \n",
    "the technology section \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `order-by`: I have specifie that the newest items should be closer to the front of the query list \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `api-key`: I have left this as test (which works here), but for *real* deployment of such a spider\n",
    "a real API key should be specified \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `page-size`: The number of results to return. "
